# Defines dolphinrvz: a shared library exposing DiscIO's ISO/GCZ/WIA/RVZ converter (the
# same functionality as Dolphin's own `dolphin-tool convert`) through the C API in
# dolphinrvz.h, instead of a CLI executable. Links the same discio + uicommon targets (and
# therefore the same third-party dependencies) the official dolphin-tool CLI links -- see
# README.dolphinrvz.md for why.

# dolphinrvz links discio, which links PUBLIC core (see README.dolphinrvz.md) -- and as
# a shared library, every symbol core's object files reference must resolve at link time
# (unlike a plain .lib, which can defer that to whatever executable eventually links it).
# core calls out to a set of Host_* callback functions that it expects some embedding
# frontend to implement (update window title, report focus state, etc) -- confirmed
# directly: the official dolphin-tool CLI satisfies these the same way, by compiling in
# this exact no-op stub file rather than defining its own.
